# Quiz-App
Firstly, we are reading from file called Testfile.txt which contains the questions and answers for the game. Then, we are making instances of the Question class and instances of the User class, and we add the questions with their answers to a list of questions. We are asking then the users to enter their usernames and the quiz starts. All the actions are executed on the console and the users are asked to type their answer for each question. The users have to type what the correct answer according to them is, and they receive points if they answer correctly. If their answer isn't correct, however, they do not receive any points and the correct answer for the question is displayed.So, in short, the users accumulate points for answering correctly and receive no points for a wrong answer. After the users answer all the questions, the winner's final score together with their username is displayed and the game ends. The  winner's result are then sent and kept in a separate file called RankList.txt. There are also some Unit tests done, each file contains info what it represents and shows its functionality as part of the whole program.
